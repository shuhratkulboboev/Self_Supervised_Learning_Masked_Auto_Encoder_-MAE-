# Self_Supervised_Learning_Masked_Auto_Encoder_-MAE-
Pytorch, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib,Keras :

I did this big project from the Advanced Machine Learning course when I studied at Ajou University in Korea with two Korean students. The purpose of this project is to optimize the performance of self-supervised learning algorithms like making images more accurate and clear. Actually, this should be trained on the ImageNet dataset but we did not have the appropriate environment due to the lack of CPU namely a powerful computer. So, we used the CIFAR-10 dataset. One important thing about it is that at the beginning, it had been trained using vision transform but we changed it to Wavelet transform in order to increase the performance of the model. All other explanations and detailed results are given in two files.
